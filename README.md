# mini-TFHE

This was my senior engineering design project for the **Fall 2025** semester at Case Western Reserve University.
We explore homomorphic encryption algorithms, how to implement them in hardware, and how we can address computational
bottlenecks of such homomorphic encryption algorithms.

## Preface 

By definition, homomorphic encryption algorithms are a class of algorithms which preserve privacy when doing computations over encrypted data sets, also known as ciphertexts. What makes it homomorphic is that doing basic operations like addition with these ciphertexts
